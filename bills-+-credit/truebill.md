The Truebill app helps you find all of your subscriptions and cancel unwanted services. Use it if you want to know exactly how much you're being charged every month for recurring bills like gym memberships, cell phones, entertainment streaming services, and utilities. Those $5 and $10 monthly subscriptions add up, and you shouldn't pay for services you aren't using regularly. Truebill helps you quickly cancel memberships you no longer want. It also gives you the information you need to lower inflated \(but necessary\) bills, like your cell phone and cable services.

### What it does:

* See all of your expected recurring payments on a calendar list each month so you always know what bills you'll get hit with on any given day
* Get a quick glance at how much you've spent so far this month, as well as how it compares to your spending from the previous month
* Use the built-in concierge service to negotiate lower bill rates and cancel unwanted subscriptions on your behalf for a fee

### What it lacks:

The Truebill app isn't a detailed budgeting or financial management app. Beyond the app's hands-on concierge service, which will help you lower and cancel your bills, this is more of a personal finance analysis tool that looks specifically at your recurring bill and subscription spending rather than your overall \(incl. variable\) spending.

### How to get started:

We found it fairly easy to get started with Truebill. Here are the two main onboarding steps:

* Connect any \(or all\) of your banking and credit card accounts. You can connect just one to get started, but you don't really see the true picture of your spending and recurring subscriptions unless you connect all of them.
* If you want to have a Truebill representative lower bills on your behalf \(and you're okay with them charging you 40% of the negotiated savings\), just upload the bill you want to lower and send it to the team. Easy as that.

### Who this app is best suited for:

Truebill is great for anyone who has a lot of subscriptions and/or bills and wants to manage them better. If you feel like you don't know where your money is going each month, it may be due to your autopay subscriptions. Use this app to help you identify where you can save by lowering bills – or cancelling some subscriptions entirely.
