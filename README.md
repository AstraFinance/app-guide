### The Fintech App Guide is a curated and open source guide to the best mobile apps for managing your money. 

We have used each app in this collection and found it to be valuable in one or more category, including utility, cost, or innovation. We are hosting it here publicly for anyone to use or reference because we all want to do more with our money and we believe everyone should have a means to discover or sort the available fintech tools.
